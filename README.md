The Service Management System is a Django-based web application that allows customers to submit and track gas service requests online. It features user authentication, request tracking, an admin panel for management, and role-based access control. The system improves service efficiency, reduces wait times, and enhances customer experience for gas utility companies. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
